# First project
### RPG text game with character XP/LVL and class system.
It has a city menu where you can restore you health or buy pets that buff your stats, potions (will restore HP in the future) and also you can buy some gear to boost your character.
You can save your progress in the city so you dont lose your progress.

More character classes, monsters, cities and a lot more to come in the future
